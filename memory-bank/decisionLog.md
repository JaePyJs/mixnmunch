# Decision Log

This document records significant architectural and technical decisions made throughout the project lifecycle.

## Format for Entries
Each decision should be logged with the following information:
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Decision:** (A concise summary of the decision)
- **Rationale:** (The reasons behind making this decision, including alternatives considered and why they were not chosen)
- **Implications:** (Potential consequences, trade-offs, or impacts on other parts of the system or future development)
- **Status:** (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Implemented, Deprecated)
- **Stakeholders Involved:** (Who participated in or approved the decision)

## Log Entries

### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Initial Decision Log Setup
- **Decision:** Create a centralized decision log to track key architectural and technical choices.
- **Rationale:** To maintain a clear history of why certain decisions were made, facilitating onboarding of new team members, and providing context for future architectural reviews or changes.
- **Implications:** Requires consistent effort to keep the log updated. Improves project transparency and knowledge sharing.
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Stakeholders Involved:** AI Assistant

### [2025-05-11 20:02:44] - Adopt Comprehensive Refactoring Plan
- **Decision:** Proceed with a significant refactoring of the Mix and Munch application to improve overall code structure and maintainability.
- **Rationale:** The existing codebase exhibits a mix of a monolithic `main.js` and emerging modular components, leading to redundancy, potential conflicts, and maintainability challenges. A structured refactor towards a fully modular architecture, orchestrated by a central `MixAndMunchApp` class, was deemed the most effective way to address these issues and establish a more robust foundation for future development. The detailed plan is documented in `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`.
- **Implications:** This will be a substantial effort involving changes to HTML structure (script loading), JavaScript module organization, and logic migration across multiple files. It aims to significantly improve code clarity, reduce complexity, enhance testability, and make future feature development more efficient. Short-term, it requires careful, step-by-step implementation to avoid breaking existing functionality.
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Stakeholders Involved:** User, AI Assistant
